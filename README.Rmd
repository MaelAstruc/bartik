# bartik

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bartik is to do Bartik instrumental variable estimations and simply test their validity.

For now I plan to use this package to do my literature review on the Bartik instrument, what are the limitations, how to test its validity and learn to do a package from scratch.

**The current code cannot be used.**

<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- You can install the development version of bartik like so: -->

<!-- ``` {r} -->

<!-- devtools::install_github("MaelAstruc/bartik") -->

<!-- ``` -->

## Example

For now, no example is available.
